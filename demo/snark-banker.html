<h2>Fit the First: The Landing</h2>


<p><bellman>"Just the place for a Snark!"</bellman> <narrator>the Bellman cried,<br />
   As he landed his crew with care;<br />
Supporting each man on the top of the tide<br />
   By a finger entwined in his hair.</narrator></p>

<p><bellman>"Just the place for a Snark! I have said it twice:<br />
   That alone should encourage the crew.<br />
Just the place for a Snark! I have said it thrice:<br />
   What I tell you three times is true."</bellman></p>

<p><narrator>The crew was complete: it included a Boots&mdash;<br />
   A maker of Bonnets and Hoods&mdash;<br />
A Barrister, brought to arrange their disputes&mdash;<br />
   And a Broker, to value their goods.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>A Billiard-marker, whose skill was immense,<br />
   Might perhaps have won more than his share&mdash;<br />
But a Banker, engaged at enormous expense,<br />
   Had the whole of their cash in his care.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>There was also a Beaver, that paced on the deck,<br />
   Or would sit making lace in the bow:<br />
And had often (the Bellman said) saved them from wreck,<br />
   Though none of the sailors knew how.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>There was one who was famed for the number of things<br />
   He forgot when he entered the ship:<br />
His umbrella, his watch, all his jewels and rings,<br />
   And the clothes he had bought for the trip.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He had forty-two boxes, all carefully packed,<br />
   With his name painted clearly on each:<br />
But, since he omitted to mention the fact,<br />
   They were all left behind on the beach.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The loss of his clothes hardly mattered, because<br />
   He had seven coats on when he came,<br />
With three pair of boots&mdash;but the worst of it was,<br />
   He had wholly forgotten his name.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He would answer to </narrator><xx>"Hi!"</xx> <narrator>or to any loud cry,</narrator><br />
   <narrator>Such as</narrator> <xx>"Fry me!"</xx> <narrator>or</narrator> <xx>"Fritter my wig!"</xx><br />
<narrator>To</narrator> <xx>"What-you-may-call-um!"</xx> <narrator>or</narrator> <xx>"What-was-his-name!"</xx><br />
   <narrator>But especially</narrator> <xx>"Thing-um-a-jig!"</xx></p>

<p><narrator>While, for those who preferred a more forcible word,<br />
   He had different names from these:</narrator><br />
<narrator>His intimate friends called him </narrator><xx>"Candle-ends,"</xx><br />
   <narrator>And his enemies</narrator> <xx>"Toasted-cheese."</xx></p>

<p><bellman>"His form is ungainly&mdash;his intellect small&mdash;"</bellman><br />
   <narrator>(So the Bellman would often remark)</narrator><br />
<bellman>"But his courage is perfect! And that, after all,<br />
   Is the thing that one needs with a Snark."</bellman></p>

<p><narrator>He would joke with haenas, returning their stare<br />
   With an impudent wag of the head:<br />
And he once went a walk, paw-in-paw, with a bear,</narrator><br />
   <baker>"Just to keep up its spirits,"</baker> <narrator>he said.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He came as a Baker: but owned, when too late&mdash;<br />
   And it drove the poor Bellman half-mad&mdash;<br />
He could <baker>only bake Bride-cake</baker>&mdash;for which, I may state,<br />
   No materials were to be had.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The last of the crew needs especial remark,<br />
   Though he looked an incredible dunce:<br />
He had just one idea&mdash;but, that one being </narrator><butcher>"Snark,"</butcher><br />
   <narrator>The good Bellman engaged him at once.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He came as a Butcher: but gravely declared,<br />
   When the ship had been sailing a week,<br />
He could <butcher>only kill Beavers</butcher>. The Bellman looked scared,<br />
   And was almost too frightened to speak:</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>But at length he explained, in a tremulous tone,<br />
   There was <bellman>only one Beaver on board</bellman>;<br />
And that was a tame one he had of his own,<br />
   Whose <bellman>death would be deeply deplored</bellman>.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The Beaver, who happened to hear the remark,<br />
   Protested, with tears in its eyes,<br />
That not even the rapture of hunting the Snark<br />
   Could atone for that dismal surprise!</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>It strongly advised that the Butcher should be<br />
   Conveyed in a separate ship:<br />
But the Bellman declared that would never agree<br />
   With the plans he had made for the trip:</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Navigation was always a difficult art,<br />
   Though with only one ship and one bell:<br />
And he feared he must really decline, for his part,<br />
   Undertaking another as well.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The Beaver's best course was, no doubt, to procure<br />
   A second-hand dagger-proof coat&mdash;<br />
So the Baker advised it&mdash;and next, to insure<br />
   Its life in some Office of note:</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>This the Banker suggested, and offered for hire</narrator><br />
   <banker>(On moderate terms), or for sale,</banker><br />
<narrator>Two excellent Policies,</narrator> <banker>one Against Fire,</banker><br />
   <banker>And one Against Damage From Hail.</banker></p>

<p><narrator>Yet still, ever after that sorrowful day,<br />
   Whenever the Butcher was by,<br />
The Beaver kept looking the opposite way,<br />
   And appeared unaccountably shy.</narrator></p>

<h2>Fit the Second: The Bellman's Speech</h2>


<p><narrator>The Bellman himself they all praised to the skies&mdash;</narrator><br />
   <crew>Such a carriage, such ease and such grace!<br />
    Such solemnity, too!</crew> <narrator>One could see he was wise,<br />
       The moment one looked in his face!</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He had bought a large map representing the sea,<br />
   Without the least vestige of land:<br />
And the crew were much pleased when they found it to be<br />
   A map they could all understand.</narrator></p>

<p><bellman>"What's the good of Mercator's North Poles and Equators,<br />
   Tropics, Zones, and Meridian Lines?"</bellman><br />
<narrator>So the Bellman would cry: and the crew would reply</narrator><br />
   <crew>"They are merely conventional signs!</crew></p>

<p><crew>"Other maps are such shapes, with their islands and capes!<br />
   But we've got our brave Captain to thank</crew><br />
<narrator>(So the crew would protest)</narrator> <crew>"that he's bought us the best&mdash;<br />
   A perfect and absolute blank!"</crew></p>

<p><narrator>This was charming, no doubt; but they shortly found out<br />
   That the Captain they trusted so well<br />
Had only one notion for crossing the ocean,<br />
   And that was to tingle his bell.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He was thoughtful and grave&mdash;but the orders he gave<br />
   Were enough to bewilder a crew.<br />
When he cried</narrator> <bellman>"Steer to starboard, but keep her head larboard!"</bellman><br />
   <narrator>What on earth was the helmsman to do?</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Then the bowsprit got mixed with the rudder sometimes:<br />
   A thing, as the Bellman remarked,<br />
That frequently happens in tropical climes,<br />
   When a vessel is, so to speak, </narrator><bellman>"snarked."</bellman></p>

<p><narrator>But the principal failing occurred in the sailing,<br />
   And the Bellman, perplexed and distressed,<br />
Said he had hoped, at least,</narrator> <bellman>when the wind blew due East,<br />
   That the ship would not travel due West!</bellman></p>

<p><narrator>But the danger was past&mdash;they had landed at last,<br />
   With their boxes, portmanteaus, and bags:<br />
Yet at first sight the crew were not pleased with the view,<br />
   Which consisted to chasms and crags.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The Bellman perceived that their spirits were low,<br />
   And repeated in musical tone<br />
Some jokes he had kept for a season of woe&mdash;<br />
   But the crew would do nothing but</narrator> <crew>groan</crew>.</p>

<p><narrator>He served out some grog with a liberal hand,<br />
   And bade them sit down on the beach:<br />
And they could not but own that their Captain looked grand,<br />
   As he stood and delivered his speech.</narrator></p>

<p><bellman>"Friends, Romans, and countrymen, lend me your ears!"</bellman><br />
   <narrator>(They were all of them fond of quotations:<br />
    So they drank to his health, and they gave him</narrator> <crew>three cheers,</crew><br />
   <narrator>While he served out additional rations).</narrator></p>

<p><bellman>"We have sailed many months, we have sailed many weeks,<br />
   (Four weeks to the month you may mark),<br />
But never as yet ('tis your Captain who speaks)<br />
   Have we caught the least glimpse of a Snark!</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"We have sailed many weeks, we have sailed many days,<br />
   (Seven days to the week I allow),<br />
But a Snark, on the which we might lovingly gaze,<br />
   We have never beheld till now!</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"Come, listen, my men, while I tell you again<br />
   The five unmistakable marks<br />
By which you may know, wheresoever you go,<br />
   The warranted genuine Snarks.</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"Let us take them in order. The first is the taste,<br />
   Which is meagre and hollow, but crisp:<br />
Like a coat that is rather too tight in the waist,<br />
   With a flavour of Will-o'-the-wisp.</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"Its habit of getting up late you'll agree<br />
   That it carries too far, when I say<br />
That it frequently breakfasts at five-o'clock tea,<br />
   And dines on the following day.</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"The third is its slowness in taking a jest.<br />
   Should you happen to venture on one,<br />
It will sigh like a thing that is deeply distressed:<br />
   And it always looks grave at a pun.</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"The fourth is its fondness for bathing-machines,<br />
   Which it constantly carries about,<br />
And believes that they add to the beauty of scenes&mdash;<br />
   A sentiment open to doubt.</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"The fifth is ambition. It next will be right<br />
   To describe each particular batch:<br />
Distinguishing those that have feathers, and bite,<br />
   From those that have whiskers, and scratch.</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"For, although common Snarks do no manner of harm,<br />
   Yet, I feel it my duty to say,<br />
Some are Boojums&mdash;"</bellman> <narrator>The Bellman broke off in alarm,<br />
   For the Baker had fainted away.</narrator></p>

<h2>Fit the Third: The Baker's Tale</h2>


<p><narrator>They roused him with muffins&mdash;they roused him with ice&mdash;<br />
   They roused him with mustard and cress&mdash;<br />
They roused him with jam and judicious advice&mdash;<br />
   They set him conundrums to guess.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>When at length he sat up and was able to speak,<br />
   His sad story he offered to tell;<br />
And the Bellman cried</narrator> <bellman>"Silence! Not even a shriek!"</bellman><br />
   <narrator>And excitedly tingled his bell.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>There was silence supreme! Not a shriek, not a scream,<br />
   Scarcely even a howl or a groan,<br />
As the man they called</narrator> <xx>"Ho!"</xx> <narrator>told his story of woe</narrator><br />
   <narrator>In an antediluvian tone.</narrator></p>

<p><baker>"My father and mother were honest, though poor&mdash;"</baker><br />
   <bellman>"Skip all that!"</bellman> <narrator>cried the Bellman in haste.</narrator><br />
<bellman>"If it once becomes dark, there's no chance of a Snark&mdash;<br />
   We have hardly a minute to waste!"</bellman></p>

<p><baker>"I skip forty years,"</baker> <narrator>said the Baker, in tears,</narrator><br />
   <baker>"And proceed without further remark<br />
   To the day when you took me aboard of your ship<br />
      To help you in hunting the Snark.</baker></p>

<p><baker>"A dear uncle of mine (after whom I was named)<br />
   Remarked, when I bade him farewell&mdash;"</baker><br />
<bellman>"Oh, skip your dear uncle!"</bellman> <narrator>the Bellman exclaimed,</narrator><br />
   <narrator>As he angrily tingled his bell.</narrator></p>

<p><baker>"He remarked to me then,"</baker> <narrator>said that mildest of men,</narrator><br />
   <baker>"'If your Snark be a Snark, that is right:<br />
   Fetch it home by all means&mdash;you may serve it with greens,<br />
      And it's handy for striking a light.</baker></p>

<p><baker>"'You may seek it with thimbles&mdash;and seek it with care;<br />
   You may hunt it with forks and hope;<br />
You may threaten its life with a railway-share;<br />
   You may charm it with smiles and soap&mdash;'"</baker></p>

<p>(<bellman>"That's exactly the method,"</bellman> <narrator>the Bellman bold</narrator><br />
   <narrator>In a hasty parenthesis cried,</narrator><br />
<bellman>"That's exactly the way I have always been told<br />
   That the capture of Snarks should be tried!"</bellman>)</p>

<p><baker>"'But oh, beamish nephew, beware of the day,<br />
   If your Snark be a Boojum! For then<br />
You will softly and suddenly vanish away,<br />
   And never be met with again!'</baker></p>

<p><baker>"It is this, it is this that oppresses my soul,<br />
   When I think of my uncle's last words:<br />
And my heart is like nothing so much as a bowl<br />
   Brimming over with quivering curds!</baker></p>

<p><baker>"It is this, it is this&mdash;"</baker> <bellman>"We have had that before!"</bellman><br />
   <narrator>The Bellman indignantly said.</narrator><br />
<narrator>And the Baker replied</narrator> <baker>"Let me say it once more.<br />
   It is this, it is this that I dread!</baker></p>

<p><baker>"I engage with the Snark&mdash;every night after dark&mdash;<br />
   In a dreamy delirious fight:<br />
I serve it with greens in those shadowy scenes,<br />
   And I use it for striking a light:</baker></p>

<p><baker>"But if ever I meet with a Boojum, that day,<br />
   In a moment (of this I am sure),<br />
I shall softly and suddenly vanish away&mdash;<br />
   And the notion I cannot endure!"</baker></p>

</section>

<section data-fit-number="4">


<h2>Fit the Fourth: The Hunting</h2>


<p><narrator>The Bellman looked uffish, and wrinkled his brow.</narrator><br />
   <bellman>"If only you'd spoken before!<br />
   It's excessively awkward to mention it now,<br />
      With the Snark, so to speak, at the door!</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"We should all of us grieve, as you well may believe,<br />
   If you never were met with again&mdash;<br />
But surely, my man, when the voyage began,<br />
   You might have suggested it then?</bellman></p>

<p><baker>"It's excessively awkward to mention it now&mdash;<br />
   As I think I've already remarked."</baker><br />
<narrator>And the man they called</narrator> <xx>"Hi!"</xx> <narrator>replied, with a sigh,</narrator><br />
   <baker>"I informed you the day we embarked.</baker></p>

<p><baker>"You may charge me with murder&mdash;or want of sense&mdash;<br />
   (We are all of us weak at times):<br />
But the slightest approach to a false pretence<br />
   Was never among my crimes!</baker></p>

<p><baker>"I said it in Hebrew&mdash;I said it in Dutch&mdash;<br />
   I said it in German and Greek:<br />
But I wholly forgot (and it vexes me much)<br />
   That English is what you speak!"</baker></p>

<p><bellman>"'Tis a pitiful tale,"</bellman> <narrator>said the Bellman, whose face</narrator><br />
   <narrator>Had grown longer at every word:</narrator><br />
<bellman>"But, now that you've stated the whole of your case,<br />
   More debate would be simply absurd.</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"The rest of my speech"</bellman> <narrator>(he explained to his men)</narrator><br />
   <bellman>"You shall hear when I've leisure to speak it.<br />
   But the Snark is at hand, let me tell you again!<br />
      'Tis your glorious duty to seek it!</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"To seek it with thimbles, to seek it with care;<br />
   To pursue it with forks and hope;<br />
To threaten its life with a railway-share;<br />
   To charm it with smiles and soap!</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"For the Snark's a peculiar creature, that won't<br />
   Be caught in a commonplace way.<br />
Do all that you know, and try all that you don't:<br />
   Not a chance must be wasted to-day!</bellman></p>

<p><bellman>"For England expects&mdash;I forbear to proceed:<br />
   'Tis a maxim tremendous, but trite:<br />
And you'd best be unpacking the things that you need<br />
   To rig yourselves out for the fight."</bellman></p>

<p><narrator>Then the Banker endorsed a blank cheque (which he crossed),<br />
   And changed his loose silver for notes.<br />
The Baker with care combed his whiskers and hair,<br />
   And shook the dust out of his coats.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The Boots and the Broker were sharpening a spade&mdash;<br />
   Each working the grindstone in turn:<br />
But the Beaver went on making lace, and displayed<br />
   No interest in the concern:</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Though the Barrister tried to appeal to its pride,<br />
   And vainly proceeded to cite<br />
A number of cases, in which making laces</narrator><br />
   <barrister>Had been proved an infringement of right.</barrister></p>

<p><narrator>The maker of Bonnets ferociously planned<br />
   A novel arrangement of bows:<br />
While the Billiard-marker with quivering hand<br />
   Was chalking the tip of his nose.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>But the Butcher turned nervous, and dressed himself fine,<br />
   With yellow kid gloves and a ruff&mdash;<br />
Said he felt it exactly like going to dine,<br />
   Which the Bellman declared was all </narrator><bellman>"stuff."</bellman></p>

<p><butcher>"Introduce me, now there's a good fellow,"</butcher> <narrator>he said,</narrator><br />
   <butcher>"If we happen to meet it together!"</butcher><br />
<narrator>And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head,<br />
   Said</narrator> <bellman>"That must depend on the weather."</bellman></p>

<p><narrator>The Beaver went simply galumphing about,<br />
   At seeing the Butcher so shy:<br />
And even the Baker, though stupid and stout,<br />
   Made an effort to wink with one eye.</narrator></p>

<p><bellman>"Be a man!"</bellman> <narrator>said the Bellman in wrath, as he heard<br />
   The Butcher beginning to sob.</narrator><br />
<bellman>"Should we meet with a Jubjub, that desperate bird,<br />
   We shall need all our strength for the job!"</bellman></p>

<h2>Fit the Fifth: The Beaver's Lesson</h1>


<p><narrator>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br />
   They pursued it with forks and hope;<br />
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
   They charmed it with smiles and soap.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Then the Butcher contrived an ingenious plan<br />
   For making a separate sally;<br />
And had fixed on a spot unfrequented by man,<br />
   A dismal and desolate valley.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>But the very same plan to the Beaver occurred:<br />
   It had chosen the very same place:<br />
Yet neither betrayed, by a sign or a word,<br />
   The disgust that appeared in his face.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Each thought he was thinking of nothing but</narrator> <crew>"Snark"</crew><br />
   <narrator>And the glorious work of the day;<br />
And each tried to pretend that he did not remark<br />
   That the other was going that way.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>But the valley grew narrow and narrower still,<br />
   And the evening got darker and colder,<br />
Till (merely from nervousness, not from good will)<br />
   They marched along shoulder to shoulder.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Then a </narrator><snark>scream</snark><narrator>, shrill and high, rent the shuddering sky,<br />
   And they knew that some danger was near:<br />
The Beaver turned pale to the tip of its tail,<br />
   And even the Butcher felt queer.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He thought of his childhood, left far far behind&mdash;<br />
   That blissful and innocent state&mdash;<br />
The sound so exactly recalled to his mind<br />
   A pencil that squeaks on a slate!</narrator></p>

<p><butcher>"'Tis the voice of the Jubjub!"</butcher> <narrator>he suddenly cried.</narrator><br />
   <narrator>(This man, that they used to call "Dunce.")</narrator><br />
<butcher>"As the Bellman would tell you,"</butcher> <narrator>he added with pride,</narrator><br />
   <butcher>"I have uttered that sentiment once.</butcher></p>

<p><butcher>"'Tis the note of the Jubjub! Keep count, I entreat;<br />
   You will find I have told it you twice.<br />
Tis the song of the Jubjub! The proof is complete,<br />
   If only I've stated it thrice."</butcher></p>

<p><narrator>The Beaver had counted with scrupulous care,<br />
   Attending to every word:<br />
But it fairly lost heart, and outgrabe in despair,<br />
   When the third repetition occurred.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>It felt that, in spite of all possible pains,<br />
   It had somehow contrived to lose count,<br />
And the only thing now was to rack its poor brains<br />
   By reckoning up the amount.</narrator></p>

<p><beaver>"Two added to one&mdash;if that could but be done,"</beaver><br />
   <narrator>It said,</narrator> <beaver>"with one's fingers and thumbs!"</beaver><br />
<narrator>Recollecting with tears how, in earlier years,<br />
   It had taken no pains with its sums.</narrator></p>

<p><butcher>"The thing can be done,"</butcher> <narrator>said the Butcher, </narrator><butcher>"I think.<br />
   The thing must be done, I am sure.<br />
The thing shall be done! Bring me paper and ink,<br />
   The best there is time to procure."</butcher></p>

<p><narrator>The Beaver brought paper, portfolio, pens,<br />
   And ink in unfailing supplies:<br />
While strange creepy creatures came out of their dens,<br />
   And watched them with wondering eyes.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>So engrossed was the Butcher, he heeded them not,<br />
   As he wrote with a pen in each hand,<br />
And explained all the while in a popular style<br />
   Which the Beaver could well understand.</narrator></p>

<p><butcher>"Taking Three as the subject to reason about&mdash;<br />
   A convenient number to state&mdash;<br />
We add Seven, and Ten, and then multiply out<br />
   By One Thousand diminished by Eight.</butcher></p>

<p><butcher>"The result we proceed to divide, as you see,<br />
   By Nine Hundred and Ninety and Two:<br />
Then subtract Seventeen, and the answer must be<br />
   Exactly and perfectly true.</butcher></p>

<p><butcher>"The method employed I would gladly explain,<br />
   While I have it so clear in my head,<br />
If I had but the time and you had but the brain&mdash;<br />
   But much yet remains to be said.</butcher></p>

<p><butcher>"In one moment I've seen what has hitherto been<br />
   Enveloped in absolute mystery,<br />
And without extra charge I will give you at large<br />
   A Lesson in Natural History."</butcher></p>

<p><narrator>In his genial way he proceeded to say<br />
   (Forgetting all laws of propriety,<br />
And that giving instruction, without introduction,<br />
   Would have caused quite a thrill in Society),</narrator></p>

<p><butcher>"As to temper the Jubjub's a desperate bird,<br />
   Since it lives in perpetual passion:<br />
Its taste in costume is entirely absurd&mdash;<br />
   It is ages ahead of the fashion:</butcher></p>

<p><butcher>"But it knows any friend it has met once before:<br />
   It never will look at a bribe:<br />
And in charity-meetings it stands at the door,<br />
   And collects&mdash;though it does not subscribe.</butcher></p>

<p><butcher>"Its flavour when cooked is more exquisite far<br />
   Than mutton, or oysters, or eggs:<br />
(Some think it keeps best in an ivory jar,<br />
   And some, in mahogany kegs:)</butcher></p>

<p><butcher>"You boil it in sawdust: you salt it in glue:<br />
   You condense it with locusts and tape:<br />
Still keeping one principal object in view&mdash;<br />
   To preserve its symmetrical shape."</butcher></p>

<p><narrator>The Butcher would gladly have talked till next day,<br />
   But he felt that the Lesson must end,<br />
And he wept with delight in attempting to say<br />
   He considered the Beaver his friend.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>While the Beaver confessed, with affectionate looks<br />
   More eloquent even than tears,<br />
It had learned in ten minutes far more than all books<br />
   Would have taught it in seventy years.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>They returned hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned<br />
   (For a moment) with noble emotion,<br />
Said </narrator><bellman>"This amply repays all the wearisome days<br />
   We have spent on the billowy ocean!"</bellman></p>

<p><narrator>Such friends, as the Beaver and Butcher became,<br />
   Have seldom if ever been known;<br />
In winter or summer, 'twas always the same&mdash;<br />
   You could never meet either alone.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>And when quarrels arose&mdash;as one frequently finds<br />
   Quarrels will, spite of every endeavour&mdash;<br />
The song of the Jubjub recurred to their minds,<br />
   And cemented their friendship for ever!</narrator></p>

<h2>Fit the Sixth: The Barrister's Dream</h2>


<p><narrator>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br />
   They pursued it with forks and hope;<br />
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
   They charmed it with smiles and soap.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>But the Barrister, weary of proving in vain<br />
   That the Beaver's lace-making was wrong,<br />
Fell asleep, and in dreams saw the creature quite plain<br />
   That his fancy had dwelt on so long.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He dreamed that he stood in a shadowy Court,<br />
   Where the Snark, with a glass in its eye,<br />
Dressed in gown, bands, and wig, was defending a pig<br />
   On the charge of deserting its sty.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The Witnesses proved, without error or flaw,<br />
   That the sty was deserted when found:<br />
And the Judge kept explaining the state of the law<br />
   In a soft under-current of sound.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The indictment had never been clearly expressed,<br />
   And it seemed that the Snark had begun,<br />
And had spoken three hours, before any one guessed<br />
   What the pig was supposed to have done.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The Jury had each formed a different view<br />
   (Long before the indictment was read),<br />
And they all spoke at once, so that none of them knew<br />
   One word that the others had said.</narrator></p>

<p><judge>"You must know&mdash;"</judge> <narrator>said the Judge: but the Snark exclaimed</narrator> <snark>"Fudge!"</snark><br />
   <judge>That statute is obsolete quite!<br />
   Let me tell you, my friends, the whole question depends<br />
      On an ancient manorial right.</judge></p>

<p><judge>"In the matter of Treason the pig would appear<br />
   To have aided, but scarcely abetted:<br />
While the charge of Insolvency fails, it is clear,<br />
   If you grant the plea 'never indebted.'</judge></p>

<p><judge>"The fact of Desertion I will not dispute;<br />
   But its guilt, as I trust, is removed<br />
(So far as relates to the costs of this suit)<br />
   By the Alibi which has been proved.</judge></p>

<p><judge>"My poor client's fate now depends on your votes."</judge><br />
   <narrator>Here the speaker sat down in his place,<br />
   And directed the Judge to refer to his notes<br />
      And briefly to sum up the case.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>But the Judge said he never had summed up before;<br />
   So the Snark undertook it instead,<br />
And summed it so well that it came to far more<br />
   Than the Witnesses ever had said!</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>When the verdict was called for, the Jury declined,<br />
   As the word was so puzzling to spell;<br />
But they ventured to hope that the Snark wouldn't mind<br />
   Undertaking that duty as well.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>So the Snark found the verdict, although, as it owned,<br />
   It was spent with the toils of the day:<br />
When it said the word </narrator><snark>"GUILTY!"</snark> <narrator>the Jury all groaned,<br />
   And some of them fainted away.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Then the Snark pronounced sentence, the Judge being quite<br />
   Too nervous to utter a word:<br />
When it rose to its feet, there was silence like night,<br />
   And the fall of a pin might be heard.</narrator></p>

<p><snark>"Transportation for life"</snark> <narrator>was the sentence it gave,</narrator><br />
   <snark>"And then to be fined forty pound."</snark><br />
<narrator>The Jury all cheered, though the Judge said he feared<br />
    That the phrase was</narrator> <judge>not legally sound.</judge></p>

<p><narrator>But their wild exultation was suddenly checked<br />
   When the jailer informed them, with tears,<br />
Such a sentence would have not the slightest effect,<br />
   As the pig had been dead for some years.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The Judge left the Court, looking deeply disgusted:<br />
   But the Snark, though a little aghast,<br />
As the lawyer to whom the defence was intrusted,<br />
   Went bellowing on to the last.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Thus the Barrister dreamed, while the bellowing seemed<br />
   To grow every moment more clear:<br />
Till he woke to the knell of a furious bell,<br />
   Which the Bellman rang close at his ear.</narrator></p>

<h2>Fit the Seventh: The Banker's Fate</h2>



<p><narrator>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br />
   They pursued it with forks and hope;<br />
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
   They charmed it with smiles and soap.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>And the Banker, inspired with a courage so new<br />
   It was matter for general remark,<br />
Rushed madly ahead and was lost to their view<br />
   In his zeal to discover the Snark</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>But while he was seeking with thimbles and care,<br />
   A Bandersnatch swiftly drew nigh<br />
And grabbed at the Banker, who</narrator> <banker>shrieked</banker> <narrator>in despair,<br />
   For he knew it was useless to fly.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He offered large discount&mdash;he offered a cheque<br />
   (Drawn </narrator><banker>"to bearer"</banker><narrator>) for seven-pounds-ten:<br />
   But the Bandersnatch merely extended its neck<br />
      And grabbed at the Banker again.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Without rest or pause&mdash;while those frumious jaws<br />
   Went savagely snapping around&mdash;<br />
He skipped and he hopped, and he floundered and flopped,<br />
   Till fainting he fell to the ground.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>The Bandersnatch fled as the others appeared<br />
   Led on by that fear-stricken yell:<br />
And the Bellman remarked</narrator> <bellman>"It is just as I feared!"</bellman><br />
   <narrator>And solemnly tolled on his bell.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>He was black in the face, and they scarcely could trace<br />
   The least likeness to what he had been:<br />
While so great was his fright that his waistcoat turned white&mdash;<br />
   A wonderful thing to be seen!</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>To the horror of all who were present that day,<br />
   He uprose in full evening dress,<br />
And with senseless grimaces endeavoured to say<br />
   What his tongue could no longer express.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Down he sank in a chair&mdash;ran his hands through his hair&mdash;<br />
   And chanted in mimsiest tones<br />
Words whose utter inanity proved his insanity,<br />
   While he rattled a couple of bones.</narrator></p>

<p><bellman>"Leave him here to his fate&mdash;it is getting so late!"</bellman><br />
   <narrator>The Bellman exclaimed in a fright.</narrator><br />
<bellman>"We have lost half the day. Any further delay,<br />
   And we sha'n't catch a Snark before night!"</bellman></p>

<h2>Fit the Eighth: The Vanishing</h2>

<p><narrator>They sought it with thimbles, they sought it with care;<br />
   They pursued it with forks and hope;<br />
They threatened its life with a railway-share;<br />
   They charmed it with smiles and soap.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>They shuddered to think that the chase might fail,<br />
   And the Beaver, excited at last,<br />
Went bounding along on the tip of its tail,<br />
   For the daylight was nearly past.</narrator></p>

<p><bellman>"There is Thingumbob shouting!"</bellman> <narrator>the Bellman said,</narrator><br />
   <bellman>"He is shouting like mad, only hark!<br />
   He is waving his hands, he is wagging his head,<br />
      He has certainly found a Snark!"</bellman></p>

<p><narrator>They gazed in delight, while the Butcher exclaimed</narrator><br />
   <butcher>"He was always a desperate wag!"</butcher><br />
<narrator>They beheld him&mdash;their Baker&mdash;their hero unnamed&mdash;<br />
   On the top of a neighbouring crag,</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>Erect and sublime, for one moment of time,<br />
   In the next, that wild figure they saw<br />
(As if stung by a spasm) plunge into a chasm,<br />
   While they waited and listened in awe.</narrator></p>

<p><baker>"It's a Snark!"<baker> <narrator>was the sound that first came to their ears,<br />
   And seemed almost too good to be true.<br />
Then followed a torrent of laughter and cheers:<br />
   Then the ominous words</narrator> "It's a Boo&mdash;"</p>

<p><narrator>Then, silence. Some fancied they heard in the air<br />
   A weary and wandering sigh<br />
That sounded like</narrator> <baker>"-jum!"</baker> <narrator>but the others declare<br />
   It was only a breeze that went by.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>They hunted till darkness came on, but they found<br />
   Not a button, or feather, or mark,<br />
By which they could tell that they stood on the ground<br />
   Where the Baker had met with the Snark.</narrator></p>

<p><narrator>In the midst of the word he was trying to say,<br />
   In the midst of his laughter and glee,<br />
He had softly and suddenly vanished away&mdash;<br /></narrator>
   <snark>For the Snark was a Boojum, you see.</snark></p>
